This is my chat app following Andrew Mead Complete Node.jsDeveloper Course on Udemy, This App is used for learning purposes only and not something that i interprete that I've created on my own.

In this App we used couple of technologies such as Node.js, Socket.io, Express, and others. Socket.io was the main tech used in this app for Bidirectional communication from the client to the server and server to client, providing a real time communcation between two or more parties.

The Idea of this chat app is to allow users to create chat rooms allowing them to send real time messages and chat with each other giving messages and a list of who is currently in the room, who joined, and who left!

What i participated in this app was mainly solving 98% of the challenges myself correctly , initializing and finishing the app such as adding it to a repository and pushing it to github and heroku , also changed few styles in the app using HTML and CSS.

Future possible Features or updates in the app may include adding a list of current active room so the user can choose if they wanna choose a room or create a room themselves, supporting file uploads, and adding typing icon if a user is typing.
